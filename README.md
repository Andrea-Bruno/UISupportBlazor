# AI rendered GUI for Blazor

## Our Mission

Our goal? Well, in a playful tone, we could say that we're determined to make front-end developers obsolete and send them packing! 
Just like coachmen became obsolete with the invention of the automobile, front-end developers might soon find themselves searching for new career paths. Thanks to our **Deterministic AI for Automatic Front-End Generation**, manually writing user interfaces will be a thing of the past.  
Gone are the days of endless **XAML bindings and complex integrations**, the total automation has arrived, and the revolution is here. Of course, talented front-end developers will find new ways to apply their skills, but one thing is clear: the way we build front-ends is about to change forever!

## Revolutionize Your Development Process with Cutting-Edge Front-End Automation

Discover the future of software development with our groundbreaking platform, engineered to **completely automate Blazor front-end creation**. This innovative technology allows development teams to focus on the core backend libraries and critical application functionalities, while the front-end is built seamlessly and effortlessly.

The idea behind this development system is that the programmer must focus only on the program's functionality, in practice the development focuses on the creation of a library without a graphical interface and protocols that allow the front-end to interact with the back-end. Once the back-end is compiled and the assembly is produced, an AI analyzer examines it and automatically creates the front-end with all the iteration mechanisms with it. This speeds up development considerably. The front-end is created complete with everything, including field validation mechanisms. API and iteration systems between GUI and back-end.
In the various tutorials published, for convenience the front-end project coincides with the back-end, this to facilitate these examples, from the practical side it is possible to create a back-end project as a library (therefore without a GUI), and create separate projects for the generation of Web, Mobile and Desktop applications: We are working on 3 GUI generators that cover all the cases, in this way by writing a single back-end you will have the Web, Mobile and Desktop apps ready in one go.

## Automatic API Generator

Our technology implements an automatic API generation system for remote command access that is precise, effective, and does not require writing code. This allows you to run your applications in the cloud quickly and easily without creating complicated full REST API protocol mechanisms for integration between server and client applications.
With its **unique deterministic architecture**, **real-time API layer generation**, and **error-free automation**, this technology sets a new standard for API development. As an officially licensed and copyrighted innovation, it ensures both **security** and **efficiency**, making it an indispensable tool for modern software development.

In the ever-evolving landscape of software development, automation plays a crucial role in enhancing efficiency and reducing manual workload. Traditional API development often requires extensive coding efforts, complex configurations, and precise prompt-based interactions with AI models, introducing room for potential misinterpretations and inconsistencies.

Our groundbreaking API generation system removes these uncertainties by adopting a fully deterministic approach that eliminates AI-driven interpretative errors and ensures absolute precision in API management.

### A New Approach to API Automation

Unlike AI-driven systems that rely on natural language prompts and model-based interpretations, our solution derives its intelligence from a **provider-generated assembly**. This assembly is meticulously analyzed, ensuring that API management is dynamically generated both on the **server** and **client** sides.

#### Key Advantages Over AI-Generated APIs

- **No AI Interpretation Errors** - Eliminates the risk of ambiguous prompt understanding or misconfiguration.
- **Fully Deterministic API Generation** - Every aspect of API behavior is extracted directly from a structured application assembly, ensuring precision.
- **Seamless Integration** - The automated process instantly generates an interactive API layer with zero manual intervention.
- **Accelerated Development** - Developers can focus on building features instead of troubleshooting unpredictable API responses.
- **Copyright Protection** - This highly innovative system is officially covered under a licensed copyright, securing intellectual property rights.

### How It Works

The provider-generated assembly acts as a **blueprint**, defining all necessary API interactions. Instead of relying on AI to interpret vague instructions, the system:

1. **Analyzes the assembly** structure to extract essential API functions.
2. **Generates API endpoints dynamically**, ensuring compatibility with both server-side and client-side applications.
3. **Integrates directly** into the application workflow, delivering a **plug-and-play API layer** for seamless execution.


### Revolutionizing Front-End Development with Deterministic AI

Artificial intelligence has significantly influenced software development, particularly in code generation. However, traditional AI models relying on prompt interpretation face inherent limitations: the generated code may be incomplete, inaccurate, or misaligned with the developer’s expectations. This necessitates repeated refinements, corrections, and additional iterations to achieve an acceptable outcome. In complex projects, this process can be time-consuming, requiring thorough manual reviews and multiple test cycles to resolve imperfections. As a result, the effort spent refining AI-generated code can sometimes match or exceed manual development, often failing to meet the quality standards of a senior professional developer.

To overcome these challenges, we have introduced a radically different approach. Our **Deterministic AI for Front-End Generation** relies on rigorous mathematical analysis of the assembly produced by the backend, eliminating any dependency on user-provided prompts. This system does not generate source code; instead, it dynamically constructs the front-end in real time during program execution, ensuring absolute precision and strict adherence to predefined rules. By removing uncertainties caused by misinterpretations and incomplete descriptions, our methodology guarantees flawless and highly efficient results.

This innovative framework enables the **instant creation of front-end applications** without manual intervention. Conceptually, it treats the assembly generated by the backend and real-time execution data as an **implicit prompt**, allowing AI to analyze and interpret these elements to generate the interface seamlessly. This paradigm shift not only accelerates development cycles but also ensures superior output quality, redefining how applications are built and optimized.

By embracing this technology, software development becomes **faster, more precise, and entirely automated**, setting a new standard for front-end creation. Our approach eliminates redundant development tasks while ensuring robust reliability, fundamentally transforming the way applications are designed and deployed.

### Beyond Conventional AI Automation

Most projects leveraging AI for API generation introduce uncertainty, relying on language model interpretation, which can lead to varying outputs based on prompt phrasing. Our solution **bypasses this limitation entirely**, ensuring a fixed, **predefined** approach to API creation.

By eliminating unnecessary complexity, this technology accelerates software development, **reduces errors**, and provides a **rock-solid foundation** for API-based applications.

## Usage:

The easiest way to get started is to create a basic project using the **ProjectTemplate** found here: Blazor Auto GUI Generator Samples: [Blazor Auto GUI Generator Samples](https://github.com/Andrea-Bruno/Blazor-Auto-GUI-generator-samples)

Alternatively, you can also set up your own Blazor server project by following the steps below:

1) Create a **Blazor server** project, with **global** interactive position (be careful to set these parameters when you create your project with Visual Studio)

2) Enter the project reference or equivalent NuGet package (UISupportBlazor) to your Blazor project

3) Enable the project to be interpreted by the assembly analyzer to automatically generate the document file by adding the following tag: <GenerateDocumentationFile>True</GenerateDocumentationFile>:

```xml
  <PropertyGroup>
    <TargetFramework>net9.0</TargetFramework>
    <Nullable>enable</Nullable>
    <ImplicitUsings>enable</ImplicitUsings>
    <GenerateDocumentationFile>True</GenerateDocumentationFile>
  </PropertyGroup>

```

4) Enable HttpContext in your project (this will allow you to manage multiple sessions and therefore manage multiple users simultaneously).

Add this to your program.cs file:

```csharp

// Used to get httpContext in razor pages
builder.Services.AddHttpContextAccessor();
```


3) Add the content rendering component to the navigation menu.

```xml
@inject IHttpContextAccessor HttpContextAccessor
    ...
    ...
    ...
    ...
    @{
        var panels = UISupportBlazor.Support.GetAllClassInfo(HttpContextAccessor.HttpContext);
    }
    @* Component to add for dynamic rendering of AI-generated content *@
    <UISupportBlazor.Menu ClassesInfo="@panels"></UISupportBlazor.Menu>
    ...
```


In the file:

Components > Layout > NavMenu.razor

You should get something like this:

```xml
@inject IHttpContextAccessor HttpContextAccessor

<div class="top-row ps-3 navbar navbar-dark">
    <div class="container-fluid">
        <a class="navbar-brand" href="">YourProjectName</a>
    </div>
</div>

<input type="checkbox" title="Navigation menu" class="navbar-toggler" />

<div class="nav-scrollable" onclick="document.querySelector('.navbar-toggler').click()">
    <nav class="nav flex-column">
        <div class="nav-item px-3">
            <NavLink class="nav-link" href="" Match="NavLinkMatch.All">
                <span class="bi bi-house-door-fill-nav-menu" aria-hidden="true"></span> Home
            </NavLink>
        </div>
    </nav>
    @{
        var panels = UISupportBlazor.Support.GetAllClassInfo(HttpContextAccessor.HttpContext);
    }
    @* Component to add for dynamic rendering of AI-generated content *@
    <UISupportBlazor.Menu ClassesInfo="@panels"></UISupportBlazor.Menu>
</div>


```

6) Add the generic page in the Pages folder that shows dynamically generated UI content, this page should have the name "Nav.razor" and the content must be as follows: 

```
@page "/nav/{Id}"
<UISupportBlazor.Nav Id="@Id"></UISupportBlazor.Nav>
@code {
    [Parameter]
    public string? Id { get; set; }
}
```

7) Adapt the contents of the **\Components\Layout\NavMenu.razor.css** file, as shown here:

```css
.navbar-toggler {
    appearance: none;
    cursor: pointer;
    width: 3.5rem;

        height: calc(100vh - 3.5rem);
        overflow-y: auto;
    }
}
```
This last adjustment was made necessary because of a bug in Blazor where the ::deep directive doesn't work unless it's put first (if anyone who works on Blazor development is reading this, we suggest fixing this bug.)

8) Create, in your project, the **Panel** directory in which to put the classes that represent the back-end of your project, these will act as the basis for the automatic creation of the front-end.
